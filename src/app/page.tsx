In preclinical studies, aPD1-IL-2c demonstrated superior single-agent antitumor activity with robust immunological memory accompanied by preferential activation and expansion of functional intratumoral T cells. The antitumor activity of aPD1-IL-2c is driven by CD8+ T cells. In contrast to competitors’ products, aPD1-IL-2c is devoid of NK cell dependent toxicity. In non-human primates, aPD1-IL-2c is well tolerated at dose levels that support the clinical plan. World-wide rights are available for partnership.",

His research interest is focused on studying basic mechanisms of antitumor immune responses and identifying genes that are critical for mediating antitumor immunity and tumor immune tolerance. Dr. Lu has made several original discoveries that helped usher in novel tumor immunotherapeutic approaches. His team discovered that epithelial cytokines interleukin 33 and interleukin 36 exert strong antitumor activities and have great potential to become a new class of tumor therapeutic agents. He also demonstrated that the checkpoint molecule Tim-3 mediates tumor immune suppression by promoting regulatory T cell function in the tumor microenvironment, supporting targeting Tim-3 for tumor immunotherapy. He has published more than 100 papers in the field of immunology. Dr. Lu obtained his Ph.D. training in Immunology at Columbia University and postdoctoral training at Yale University."
